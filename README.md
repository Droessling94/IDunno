# IDunno: a NEET decision making app

### Developed by: Jordan Stone, Jorge Gonzalez, Donaldson Roessling, Joshua Diaz


- Our shared interest in video games and movies not just as a recreational 
activity but as a culture drove to the decision to make this the subject of our app.

- We built this project to solve a common issue amongst gamers and movie buffs alike which is simply " having too many options to choose from."

- No longer will the age old question ***"what do you wanna watch?"*** be met with the common response ***"...uhh idunno."*** With this app users will be able to put input their preferances to generate a movie or game that will solve their entertainment needs. If you get an answer you don't want, that's fine too! Let our application choose one for you at random!  


## How to..

Upon loading our page the user will immediately be brought to the homepage where there will be 2 'cards' displayed giving the choice between generating a movie or game option. Once an option is selected the user will be transported to the page that corresponds with their choice. For this description, we will use a the movie option as our example. 

Once transported to the movie page the user is asked questions with an array of options such as ***"Which genre would you like to watch?"*** After the user selects their preferences and clicks the submit button they will then be transferred to a results page. 

There, a 'card' with a 'next' and 'back' button. This card will display options generated by the application based on the users selected preferences with information about each option displayed underneath and an image of the option if applicable. The 'next' and 'back' buttons can be used to shuffle through the options generated by the applicaion. If the user finds any of the options interesting they can then add said option to a list of favorites that will display on the homepage when they return.
